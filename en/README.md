## What is MaixPy

MaixPy ported [Micropython](http://micropython.org/) to [K210](https://kendryte.com/) (a 64-bit dual-core RISC-V CPU with hardware FPU and convolution accelerator).  In addition to stardard MCU operations, MaixPy devices support integrated machine vision, neural network, and audio procesing capabilities enabling the development of cost effective AIOT applications.


> MicroPython is a lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language that includes a small subset of the Python standard library.  It is optimised to run on microcontrollers and in constrained environments.

> K210 created for AIOT(AI+IOT) use. Its powerful performance and low cost make it very competitive.

Micropython makes programming on K210 hardware easier. The code is open source and can be found on [GitHub]((https://github.com/sipeed/MaixPy))

To quickly give you an idea, here are a few code examples:

If we want to find an **I2C** device, we just need this code:
```python
from machine import I2C

i2c = I2C(I2C.I2C0, freq=100000, scl=28, sda=29)
devices = i2c.scan()
print(devices)
```

Again, if we want to make a **breathing light** using PWM, we just need this code:
```python
from machine import Timer,PWM
import time

tim = Timer(Timer.TIMER0, Timer.CHANNEL0, mode=Timer.MODE_PWM)
ch = PWM(tim, freq=500000, duty=50, pin=board_info.LED_G)
duty=0
dir = True
while True:
    if dir:
        duty += 10
    else:
        duty -= 10
    if duty>100:
        duty = 100
        dir = False
    elif duty<0:
        duty = 0
        dir = True
    time.sleep(0.05)
    ch.duty(duty)
```

To **take a picture**ï¼š

```python
import sensor
import image
import lcd

lcd.init()
sensor.reset()
sensor.set_pixformat(sensor.RGB565)
sensor.set_framesize(sensor.QVGA)
sensor.run(1)
while True:
    img=sensor.snapshot()
    lcd.display(img)
```


## About this documentation

This document describes:
* How to get the hardware (the board).
* How to get started with MaixPy, even if you are not an expert in embedded programming.
* MicroPython language basics
* Libraries and API reference

## Let's get started

To get started you need a development board.  There are three kind of boards:

* Dan dock with Sipeed M1(Dan) module

![Dan dock](../assets/Dan_Dock.png)

* Sipeed Maix BiT

![BiT](../assets/BiT.png)

* Sipeed Go

![Go](../assets/Go.jpg)

To get any of those boards, visit [Sipeed Official Website](https://sipeed.com/)

More hardware infomation [here](hardware/hardware.md)

To start coding, refer to the [getting started](get_started.md) section.
